  abstract = {We study non-Brownian suspensions under steady shear flow. In concentrated suspensions, we are trying to reproduce the shear thickening phenomenon seen in, for example, cornstarch. We investigate the effect of different frictional contact models. When contact acts to impose a fixed minimum separation between particles, there is a strict upper bound to the viscosity predicted by simulations. We deduce that soft or compressible contacts are a critical component of the strong shear thickening seen in experiments.},

  abstract = {In recent experiments, Blanc et al. (J Fluid Mech 746:R4, 2014) dropped a heavy sphere through a concentrated suspension of smaller, neutrally buoyant particles. They found that the application of a lateral oscillatory shear flow caused the heavy ball to fall faster on average, and that for highly concentrated suspensions, at certain moments of the cycle of shear oscillation, the heavy ball moved upwards. We use Stokesian Dynamics to model these experiments and other related scenarios. We show how the motion of the heavy particle and the microstructure of the suspension depend on two key dimensionless parameters: the frequency of the oscillations (relative to a typical settling time) and the strength of repulsive interparticle forces, relative to the buoyancy-adjusted weight of the heavy ball. We offer a mechanism which describes some of the observed behaviours: the formation and breakup of vertical repulsion chains.},

  abstract = {In many areas of suspension mechanics, such as filled polymer fluids or household products such as toothpaste, the suspending fluid itself is inherently non-Newtonian and may exhibit viscoelastic properties. In this paper, we extend the Stokesian Dynamics formalism to incorporate a simple model of viscoelasticity by using small spheres as `beads' in a bead\textendash spring dumbbell (such as is found in the derivation of Oldroyd and FENE constitutive models for dilute polymer solutions). Various different spring laws are then tested in both small-amplitude and large-amplitude oscillatory shear, and their rheological behaviour is compared to continuum constitutive models.},
