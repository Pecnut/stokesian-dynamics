  abstract = {We study non-Brownian suspensions under steady shear flow. In concentrated suspensions, we are trying to reproduce the shear thickening phenomenon seen in, for example, cornstarch. We investigate the effect of different frictional contact models. When contact acts to impose a fixed minimum separation between particles, there is a strict upper bound to the viscosity predicted by simulations. We deduce that soft or compressible contacts are a critical component of the strong shear thickening seen in experiments.},

  abstract = {In recent experiments, Blanc et al. (J Fluid Mech 746:R4, 2014) dropped a heavy sphere through a concentrated suspension of smaller, neutrally buoyant particles. They found that the application of a lateral oscillatory shear flow caused the heavy ball to fall faster on average, and that for highly concentrated suspensions, at certain moments of the cycle of shear oscillation, the heavy ball moved upwards. We use Stokesian Dynamics to model these experiments and other related scenarios. We show how the motion of the heavy particle and the microstructure of the suspension depend on two key dimensionless parameters: the frequency of the oscillations (relative to a typical settling time) and the strength of repulsive interparticle forces, relative to the buoyancy-adjusted weight of the heavy ball. We offer a mechanism which describes some of the observed behaviours: the formation and breakup of vertical repulsion chains.},

  abstract = {In many areas of suspension mechanics, such as filled polymer fluids or household products such as toothpaste, the suspending fluid itself is inherently non-Newtonian and may exhibit viscoelastic properties. In this paper, we extend the Stokesian Dynamics formalism to incorporate a simple model of viscoelasticity by using small spheres as `beads' in a bead\textendash spring dumbbell (such as is found in the derivation of Oldroyd and FENE constitutive models for dilute polymer solutions). Various different spring laws are then tested in both small-amplitude and large-amplitude oscillatory shear, and their rheological behaviour is compared to continuum constitutive models.},

  abstract = "{The motion of rigid spherical particles suspended in a low Reynolds number fluid can be related to the forces, torques, and stresslets acting upon them by 22 scalar resistance functions, commonly notated     X  11 A ,    X  12 A ,    Y  11 A, etc. Near-field asymptotic forms of these resistance functions were derived in Jeffrey and Onishi [“Calculation of the resistance and mobility functions for two unequal rigid spheres in low-Reynolds-number flow,” J. Fluid Mech. 139, 261–290 (1984)] and Jeffrey [“The calculation of the low Reynolds number resistance functions for two unequal spheres,” Phys. Fluids A 4, 16–29 (1992)]; these forms are now used in several numerical methods for suspension mechanics. However, the first of these important papers contains a number of small errors, which make it difficult for the reader to correctly evaluate the functions for parameters not explicitly tabulated. This short article comprehensively corrects these errors and adds formulas that were originally omitted from both papers, so that the reader can verify and implement the equations independently. The corrected expressions, rationalized and using contemporary nondimensionalization, are shown to match mid-field values of these scalars, which are calculated through an alternative method. A Python script to generate and evaluate these functions is provided.}",
